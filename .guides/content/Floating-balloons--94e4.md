In the left hand pane, you will find a little playground for floats. What better than balloons to play with `float`-ing elements ?

The playground is composed of 3 main parts:

1. The big balloons, numbered 1 to 5 are all block-level elements.
1. The multiple paragraphs of text underneath are used to show the interactions of floating elements with text.
1. Finally the controls, in the gray zone at the bottom which will show you and let you change if a balloon is floating or not.

### Initially
None of the balloons are floating. They are stacked on top of each others, with the paragraphs of text underneath. We will see in the next sections a series of examples, based on this game, to understand the properties of floats.
